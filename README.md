# search-for-code-snippets

Please clone the repo and in the terminal when inside the folder, please run:
1. npm i
2. npm start

The application does the following:
Fetch Code Snippet from Mock API or Json files, taken model structure from https://www.tabnine.com/code/javascript/modules/express
Shows listing of 10 snippets on page load.
The Search option will refine the code snippets based on search input.

This application is so far built in vanilla js can be improved a lot and I am working on it.

# search-for-code-snippets

Please clone the repo and in the terminal when inside the folder, please run:
1. npm i
2. npm start

The application does the following:
Fetch Code Snippet from Mock API or Json files, Identify model structure from the given example.
Show listing of 10 snippets on page load.
The Search option will refine the code snippets based on search input.

This application can be improved a lot and I am working on it.
